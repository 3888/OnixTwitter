# OnixTwitter
Test project

++There are a 'splash' page with login via Twitter (1) and the main page with 4 tabs in the application. 

++0)The first tab is 'home' (2,3).

++1) The application should load content from users’ feeds via Twitter API.  

++2)At the top of the left corner the switcher is placed. This element switches the view mode from 
the list to a vertical pager.  

++Pager mode: a user can see only one element per page and moves up/down by swiping or 
tapping particular buttons. It is the navigation button that can be implemented as the ‘float 
button’ etc.  


++3) Click/tap on the picture should open a picture preview (4) screen. 

++4) Preview must have a zoom functionality.  

++5)Profile ­ screen (5). This screen will show a user’s profile information from Twitter.  


++6) Google map screen (6) + custom markers: you can load any list of markers near Kirovograd with any text in infobubble.

++6.1) Click on infobubble should open an external link or show a pop­up.  

++7) Tab on screen 7 will be empty.  

++8) The right navigation menu has only 3 points and a logo.
  
8.2) 
++3rd point in navigation menu should be called “my skills”, click on this item open the new page. 
On this should be present any custom view plus here is you can add any functionality todemonstrate your skills in Android. 


++‘Help’ routes to any web site (use intent).
